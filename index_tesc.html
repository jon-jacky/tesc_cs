This is my page at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/user/home.htm">
The Evergreen State College</a>.
I also have a <a href="http://www.radonc.washington.edu/prostaff/jon/">page</a>
at the University of Washington.

In the Fall 2000 -- Spring 2001 academic year I taught <a
href="fofc/fofc.html">Foundations of Computing</a> in the 
<a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/user/PTS/home.htm">Part-Time Studies</a>
program.  
</p>


<p>
In Fall quarter 2001 I will teach <a
href="dsa/dsa.html">Data Structures and Algorithms</a>.
</p>

<p>
In Spring 2000 I taught <a href="cofc/cofcii.html">Concepts of Computing</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am rarely on the Evergreen campus, except when I am teaching a
class, so it's no use trying to reach me at my on-campus office or
telephone.  Instead, send me email (address below).  I try to check
email most weekdays.
