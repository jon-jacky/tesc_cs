<h2>Foundations of Computing -- Spring 2000</h2>

<h2>Jon Jacky</h2>


<p>
Spring quarter we will construct and analyze models of computing
systems.  We may consider other topics based on students' and
instructor's interests.  For example, I would like to consider issues
of usability and reliability.

<p>
One of the themes of this course is size or scale.  We move
up in scale from single programs in Fall quarter to collections of
programs (operating systems) and then to collections of computers
(networked applications) in Winter Quarter.
</p>

<p>
Another theme is depth of understanding.  A programmer's understanding
grows through three stages.  In the first stage a programmer works by
imitation and trial-and-error, copying and modifying examples.  In the
second stage a programmer can create an original program and predict
its behavior in particular situations, based on an internal mental
picture of how the computer executes the constructs of the programming
language.  In the third stage the programmer can make judgments
about the overall correctness of a program, and predict its behavior
in a wide variety of situations.  In this stage the programmer creates
an abstract model of the program and analyzes it by deduction or
simulation.
</p>

<p>
By the end of Winter term we should be well into the second stage.  In
Spring we will try to enter the third stage.  We may experiment with
modelling tools like <a href="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/">Alloy</a>
and <a

</p>

<p>
We may read books on usability such as
<b>The Trouble With Computers</b> by Thomas K. Landauer or 
<b>The Inmates are Running the Asylum</b> by Alan Cooper.
