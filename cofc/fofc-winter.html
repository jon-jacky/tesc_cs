<p>
Winter quarter we will study systems composed of many programs, 
including operating systems and networked applications.

<h3><a name="os">Operating Systems</a></h3>

<p>
An <em>operating system</em> is a collection of programs that work
together to provide the services of a computer in a convenient form to
users and programmers.
</p>

<p>
In Fall term, we will have become familiar with the ubiquitous
<b>Windows</b> operating system.  In Winter, we will learn and use
<b>Linux</b>, a popular modern version of the vastly influential
<b>Unix</b> operating system.  In addition to using Windows and Linux,
we will study the strategies their designers adopted for organizing
large software systems.
</p>

<p>
Many computer specialists find Unix (in its various versions such as
Linux etc.) to be the most productive operating system for programming
and innovative computing.  Many of the influential developments of the
last thirty years were created or first popularized on Unix systems.
</p>

<p>
Linux is a good choice for learning about operating systems because
its design is apparent and largely exposed to its users.  It is
unusually well described in many books and an immense store of on-line
material (including all the source code).

<h3><a name="net">Networked Applications</a></h3>

<p>
When you use a computer these days, it is likely that you are actually
working with several different computers that communicate 
over a network.  For example, when you use a web browser your computer
communicates with remote server computers that send the content 
you see in the web pages.
</p>

<p>
We will study how networked applications are constructed and experiment 
with building some ourselves.

<h3><a name="textbooks">Textbooks</a></h3>

<p>
I haven't chosen the textbooks yet.  I am considering these.
You should <em>not</em> run out and buy these yet!
</p>

<p>
<b>SAM'S Teach Yourself Unix in 10 Minutes</b>, William Ray, 
ISBN 0-672-31523-8, 210 pages, about $13.  (Useful if you
are a total newbie, but actually takes more than ten minutes).
</p>

<p>
<b>Linux in a Nutshell</b>, Ellen Siever, ISBN 1-56592-585-8,
O'Reilly, 612 pages, about $25. (Encyclopedic reference, highly recommended)
</p>

<p>
<b>Networked Applications: A Guide to the New Computing
Infrastructure</b>, David G. Messerschmitt, 1999, Morgan Kaufmann,
About $40. (Good topic coverage but perhaps not sufficiently
technical)
</p>

<p>
<b>Not Just Java</b>, Peter Van der Linden, About $40.  (Covers many of the
same topics as Messerschmitt, a bit more technical, heavy on the pro-Java,
anti-Microsoft advocacy)
</p>

<p>
I am still looking for a good introductory technical book on networks,
with project ideas.
</p>

<h3><a name="seminar">Seminar readings</a></h3>

<p>
I haven't chosen the seminar readings yet.  I am considering these.
</p>

<p>
Thompson and Ritchie's early papers on the Unix philosophy in
<b>Communications of the ACM</b> about 1974 and <b>Bell System
Technical Journal</b> about 1978.
</p>

<p>
"Inside Windows 95" by Andrew Schulman, Chapter 8 in <b>Windows 95 in a Nutshell</b>
from O'Reilly. (This chapter does not appear in their Windows 98 Nutshell book)
</p>

<p>
Excerpts from <b>The Unix Hater's Guide</b>
</p>

<p>
Maybe something about Microsoft's COM
</p>

<p>
<b>High Stakes, No Prisoners: A Winner's Tale of Greed and Glory in 
the Internet Wars</b>, Charles H. Ferguson, ISBN 0-8129-3143-2,
Times Books, 1999, 392 pages, about $28 (Surprisingly deep, highly recommended)
