<p>
<b>Foundations of Computing</b> is a three-quarter sequential program
intended to give the beginning -- yet strongly motivated -- student a
foundation for a computer science specialization.  We will cover
important computer science areas including theory and practice.  In
each of these areas students will be exposed to critical topics in a
meaningful though non-comprehensive way.
</p>

<p>
<a href="fofc-fall.html">Fall quarter</a> 
we will examine problem-solving in several contrasting programming languages.  
<a href="fofc-winter.html">Winter quarter</a>
we will study systems composed of many programs, 
including operating systems and networked applications.  
<a href="fofc-spring.html">Spring quarter</a> 
we will construct and analyze models of computing systems.
</p>

<p>
Programming projects will develop technical skills.  Readings and
seminars will develop presentation skills and critical judgment.
</p>

<p>
This is a three-quarter sequential program.  It is intended that 
students will begin in Fall term and continue through Winter and Spring terms.
Instructor's permission is required to enter the program in Winter or Spring.
</p>

<p>
This program is intended to complement two other offerings in Part Time
Studies, 
<a href="http://www.scn.org/edu/tesc-ds/2000-2001/index.html"
><b>Community Information Systems</b></a> (Reference #00250G) and 
<b>Object-Oriented Concepts Using UML and Java</b> (#00328M).  The schedule 
for this program does not conflict with theirs, and the program content
does not duplicate theirs.  None of these three is a prerequisite for 
any of the others.
