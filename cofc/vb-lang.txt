The Visual Basic language

----------------------------------

Layout etc.

Case is not significant.  As you type the code, the VB IDE automatically sets keywords in
bicapitalized form: ElseIf etc.

Line breaks are significant.  It must be 

 if <condition> then <statement>

or

 if <condition> then
   <statements>
 end if

but not

 if <condition>
   then <statement>

which is a syntax error.

You can break a single statement across lines by putting an underscore
character _ at the end of the line
