<p>
This spring I am teaching <a href="cofcii.html">Concepts of Computing, Section II</a>.
</p>
  
<p>
I am only on campus Wednesday evenings and alternate Saturdays.
Wednesday 5:30 -- 7:00 pm I am in lecture hall 2, and 7:30 -- 9:30 pm in Library 2220.
Saturday April 1, 15, and 29, and May 13 and 27 I am in the ACC lab
(except at lunch and during breaks I might be in the CAB Deli area).
</p>

<p>
Do not try to reach me at my on-campus office or telephone.  Instead,
send me email (address below).  I try to check email most weekdays.
</p>
 
<p>
I also have a <a href="http://www.radonc.washington.edu/prostaff/jon/">page</a>
at the University of Washington.
