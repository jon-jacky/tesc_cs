<p>
Fall quarter we will examine problem-solving in three contrasting
programming languages.

<h3><a name="languages">Languages</a></h3>

<p>
Programmers and other computer
specialists typically work in several languages, not just one.  The
differences are not merely superficial.  The languages have different
purposes, and each expresses a different notion of computation.
</p>

<p>
We will study Scheme, Awk, and Java.
</p>

<p>
<b>Scheme</b> is a dialect of Lisp, one of the oldest and most
influential programming languages.  It was invented to support
research in artificial intelligence and programming language design,
but is also useful for general purpose programming 
(for example see this <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/develop/">cool stuff</a>
and this <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/code.misc.html">
esoteric stuff</a>).
Its simplicity and power make it an excellent
vehicle for learning programming.
</p>

<p>
<b>Awk</b> is a scripting language, intended to help programmers write
small but effective programs quickly.  It is particularly well-suited
for processing text patterns (in email messages, web pages, and other
network traffic) and tabular data (from spreadsheets, databases, and
other computer output).  Other popular scripting languages are Perl,
Python and Tcl, but I believe Awk has a cleaner design and is easier
to learn.  Awk has the same expression syntax (appearance and grammar
rules) as C, C++, Java, Javascript, and Perl, but is simpler than any
of these.
</p>

<p>
<b>Java</b> is ... oh, you've heard of it? What matters for our
purposes is that it is representative of the most popular
general-purpose languages.  It has much in common with the older
workhorses C and C++ but is simpler and more reliable.
</b>

<p>
We will spend five or six weeks on Scheme and a few weeks each on
Awk and Java.  We may spend additional time on these or other languages
in the Winter and Spring, depending on student interest.

<h3><a name="textbooks">Textbooks</a></h3>

<p>
One of the goals of this course is to teach you to recognize good computer books 
and show you how to use them effectively.
</p>

<p>
The Scheme book provides detailed explanations for beginners.  The Awk book
moves more quickly.  The Java book is terse, almost telegraphic.

<b>Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer Science</b>, 2nd edition, Brian Harvey
and Matthew Wright, ISBN 0262082810, MIT Press, 1999, 612 pages.

<h3><a name="software">Software</a></h3>

<p>
The programming languages and tools for this course are installed on the 
computers at the ACC lab.  During Fall term, we will be using Windows.
During the rest of the year, we will also use Linux.
</p>

<p>
All of the programming languages and tools for this course are available for
free, and most run on several kinds of computers.  This makes it reasonable
for students to install and use the software at home if they wish.
</p>

<p>
We will use the <b>DrScheme</b> environment for programming in Scheme.
You can download DrScheme for Windows, Linux, Macintosh and several
other platforms 
<a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/">here</a>.  You
can download the example programs from <b>Simply Scheme</b> <a
href="ftp://anarres.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/scheme">here</a>.  To do the
examples in <b>Simply Scheme</b>, you must load 
<code>simply.scm</code> into <b>DrScheme</b> by typing the line
<code>(load "...\\simply.scm")</code> into the definitions window
(where <code>...</code> indicates the path to <code>simply.scm</code>
on your system, note the double <code>\\</code> in the path). 
</p>

<p>
You can download <b>Awk</b> for Windows 
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.
Awk comes included with Linux (where it is called gawk).
There is information about Awk for Macintosh 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-lang/awk/faq/">here</a>.
You can download the example programs from <b>The Awk Programming Language</b>
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sun's <b>Java</b> site is
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">here</a>.  The software we need must be
in there somewhere.  Watch this space for advice on what to 
download.

<h3><a name="seminar">Seminar readings</a></h3>

<p>
We'll frequently go beyond the popular to material intended for
a specialist audience (but every now and then we'll come back to the popular).
</p>

<p>
I haven't chosen the seminar readings for fall yet.  I am considering
this <a href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/shr.html">essay</a> 
on the philosophical and historical roots of Artificial Intelligence
research.
