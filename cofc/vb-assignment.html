<h2>Visual Basic Assignment</h2>


<p>
Back to <a href="cofcii.html">course page</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Write a Visual Basic program.  The program can be a modification of an
existing program (from the book, the course notes, or some other
source) but then you must show the original program also.
</p>

<p>
You will be evaluated on originality (creating new code, rather than
just copying code from elsewhere) and correctness (using the VB
language features correctly).
</p>

<p>
Here are some project ideas that involve modifying the example
programs, or writing a new program using the same language features.
For some examples, more than one project is suggested.
</p>

<p>
You can probably think of projects that are more fun than these.
</p>

<p>
Your evaluation will also be based on a short quiz.
It will be similar to this <a href="vb-quiz.html">practice quiz</a>,
but it will also cover material from the second lab session as well.
</p>

<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>
This <a href="vb-examples-1.html#counter">event counter</a> 
demonstrates command button and label controls, 
event subroutines, assignment statements and arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Write a small <b>hand calculator</b>.  Use command buttons
for the number keys, the <b>Enter</b> key and the <b>+</b> key etc.
Use a label to display the results.  To make it easy at first, just
provide a few keys (start with just the <b>1</b> key and a
<b>+</b> key) and only provide single digit numbers.  If you can get
that working, add more numbers and operations, and try entering and
calculating with numbers with multiple digits.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hint:</b> You may have to cope with the distinction between
<code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> data types.  The
<code>Val</code> function converts from <code>String</code> to
<code>Integer</code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Flip, Traffic</h3>

<p>
The <a href="vb-examples-1.html#flip">coin flipping simulation</a>
demonstrates random numbers and the <code>If</code> control structure, and 
the <a href="vb-examples-1.html#traffic">traffic light simulation</a>
demonstrates the shape control and the <code>Case</code> control structure.
</p>

<p>
Write a <b>randomness checker</b> generates a bunch of random
numbers in the range zero to a hundred, and plots a histogram (vertical
bar graph) showing how many numbers fell in the range 0 to 10, 11 to
19, ... , 90 to 100.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hint:</b>  You may wish to use a loop to generate a lot of 
random numbers easily, as in the <a href="vb-examples-2.html#maximum">
array search</a> example.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Root</h3>

<p>
The <a href="vb-examples-2.html#root">square root finder</a> uses
successive approximation to find a solution for the equation
<b>r<sup>2</sup> = x</b> (it finds <b>r</b> when <b>x</b> is given).
</p>

<p>
Modify the program to solve other equations.  Can you find the
<b>cube root</b>, where the equation is <b>r<sup>3</sup> = x</b>?  Can you
find a better rule for improving the approximation?  What about more
complicated equations, with more than one term?
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Maximum</h3>

<p>
The <a href="vb-examples-2.html#maximum">array search</a> program
demonstrates arrays, <code>For</code> loops, and printing to forms.
It generates an array full of random numbers, prints it, and finds the
largest one.
</p>

<p>
Use the <code>Format</code> function to make the output look nicer:
right-justify the columns on the form or ...
</p>

<p>
Modify the program to add up all the elements in the array.  Or count
all the even numbers.  Or ...
</p>

<p>
Experiment with the size of the array.  How long does it take to
create and search the array if, instead of ten elements, it has a
thousand?  A million?  How large can it be?  You could make a table of the
results, code it in HTML, and put it on your web page.  You could put
the code for the program on the page too.
</p>

<p>
Write a tiny spell checker.  Create an array of strings (words) and
see if a particular word occurs in the array.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Lines</h3>

<p>
The <a href="vb-examples-2.html#lines">text processing</a> program
demonstrates reading, processing, and writing a text file.
</p>

<p>
Write a simple text-to-HTML translator.  Read in an ordinary text
file.  Write it out with a well-formed HTML head and body.  Replace
blank lines with HTML paragraph tags.  View the output in your
browser.
</p>

<p>
Write an HTML table-of-contents generator.  Read in an HTML file.
Find all the lines with header tags.  Write out an HTML page of 
links to the header entries in the first page.
</p>

<p>
Investigate performance.  How long does it take to create and write
out a thousand lines?  A million?  (Be sure to delete large files after you
create them!)
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Orbit</h3>

<p>
The <a href="vb-examples-2.html#orbit">orbital physics simulator</a>
demonstrates coordinate system graphics, some physical laws, and
numerical integration of a differential equation.
</p>

<p>
Plot a trail to make the shape of the orbit visible.
</p>

<p>
Change the laws of physics!  What if gravity did not obey an inverse
square law, but a simple inverse, or an inverse cube?
</p>

<p>
Add a second satellite (moon or planet).  Model the gravitational
force between the two satellites.
</p>

<p>
Model a different physical system.  For example, model a billiard ball
bouncing off the edges of a table.
