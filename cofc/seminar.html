<p>
Each week, bring a very short report on your reading, with one or two 
sentences on each of these three items:
</p>

<ol>
<li>A brief description of the content of the reading.
<li>Something in the reading that you found notable or memorable.
It could be a fact or an opinion that the author expressed.
<li>A reponse to the reading: an observation, opinion, or question of your own.
</ol>

For example, here is my report in this format on the March 30 lecture
by Peter Jekel:

<blockquote>
 The lecture was about networks and network security. 
 I was surprised to learn that an ordinary personal computer
 on a cable modem might be probed by hackers several times a day.
 It made me wonder why the networks and system software 
 are so vulnerable -- why didn't the 
 manufacturers make it more secure?
</blockquote>

<p>
Each week, there will be a short quiz on the reading, consisting
of three short-answer questions, perhaps a few more.  The questions 
will be easy to answer if you have done the reading.
</p>

<p>
Your evaluation in the readings and seminar will be largely based
on your report and your quiz.  
</p>

<p>
Your evaluation in the lecture will be based on attendance only.
