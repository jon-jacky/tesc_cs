<h2>Seminar Assignments</h2>

<h4>
Wednesdays, March 29 through May 31 (JJ absent May 24), 
7:30 -- 9:30 pm, Library 2220</h4>

<p>
The readings/seminar part of the course is 3 credits (out of 8 total).
</p>

<p>
We will read and discuss about half of a book each week.
</p>

<p>
For April 5, read the first half of <strong>Cuckoo's Egg</strong>
(through chapter 30, page 163 in the paperback edition).
</p>

<p>
Each week, bring a very short report on your reading, with one or two 
sentences on each of these three items:
</p>

<ol>
<li>A brief description of the content of the reading.
<li>Something in the reading that you found notable or memorable.
It could be a fact or an opinion that the author expressed.
<li>A reponse to the reading: an observation, opinion, or question of your own.
</ol>

<p>
For example, here is my report in this format on the March 30 lecture
by Peter Jekel:
</p>

<blockquote>
 The lecture was about networks and network security. 
 I was surprised to learn that an ordinary personal computer
 on a cable modem might be probed by hackers several times a day.
 It made me wonder why the networks and system software 
 are so vulnerable -- why didn't the 
 manufacturers make it more secure?
</blockquote>

<p>
Each week, there will be a short quiz on the reading, consisting
of three short-answer questions, perhaps a few more.  The questions 
will be easy to answer if you have done the reading.
</p>

<p>
Your evaluation in the readings and seminar will be largely based
on your report and your quiz.
