<h3>How to build and run a Visual Basic program</h3>

<p>
These are the mechanics of working with Visual Basic (VB).
</p>

<h4>How to create and save a new VB program</h4>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Start VB.
</p>

<p>
Find Visual Basic on the Windows Start menu and start it.
</p>

<p>
The large VB window appears with a 
<b>New Project</b> dialog box (if there is no dialog box, bring it up by 
<b>File &gt; New Project</b>).  
</p>

<p>
Select <b>Standard Exe</b>.
The VB window shows <b>Project1</b> with an empty <b>Form1</b>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Name the project.
</p>

<p>
Select <b>Project &gt; Project1 Properties</b>.
In the <b>Project Properties</b> dialog box, change <b>Project1</b> to
your project name, say <b>Counter</b>.
</p>

<p>
The title bar on the VB window changes to match.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Name the form and set the form caption.  
</p>

<p>
The <b>Properties</b> window at the right of the VB window shows the 
properties for the form.  The first property at the top of the 
list is <b>Name</b>.  Change the name to, say, <b>frmCounter</b>.
</p>

<p>
The title bar in the Form window changes to match.
</p>

<p>
Still in the properties window, scroll down to <b>Caption</b>.
Change the caption to the same name as the project, say <b>Counter</b>.
</p>

<p>
The title bar on the form itself changes to match.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Save the form (you should always name and save the form
<em>before</em> you save the project).
</p>

<p>
Select <b>File &gt; Save frmCounter As ...</b>.  The <b>Save Form
As</b> dialog box appears.  The <b>Save in:</b> textbox shows the name
of the folder where the form will be saved.  You should create a new
folder for this project.  Navigate to the folder where you want to
keep all your VB projects and click on the new folder icon (a picture
of a folder with a little highlight).  After you create the new
folder, select that folder.  Its name should appear in the <b>Save
in:</b> box.  The form file name <b>frmCounter.frm</b> should appear
in the <b>File name:</b> box (if not, type in the correct name).
Click on <b>Save</b>.
</p>

<p>
The form is saved.
</p>

<li>
<p>
Save the project (be sure to name and save the form
<em>before</em> you save the project).
</p>

<p>
Select <b>File &gt; Save Project As ...</b>.  The <b>Save Project As</b>
dialog box appears.  The <b>Save in:</b> textbox should show the correct
folder (the one you just created for the form).  The <b>File name:</b>
box should show the correct name (<b>Counter.vbp</b> in this example).
Click on <b>Save</b>.
</p>

<p>
The project is saved.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
After you name and save the form and the project, it is a good idea to exit
and then restart VB to make sure you can restore your project --- before you 
invest a lot of work in it.
</p>


<h4>How to restore a saved VB program</h4>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Start VB.
</p>

<p>
Find Visual Basic on the Windows Start menu and start it.
</p>

<p>
The large VB window appears with a 
<b>New Project</b> dialog box.  This time choose the <b>Existing</b>
tab (if there is no dialog box, bring it up by 
<b>File &gt; Open Project</b>).  
</p>

<p>
Navigate to the folder you created earlier.  It should 
contain a <b>.vbp</b> file for the project you created earlier
(<b>Counter.vbp</b> in this example).  Select that file.
</p>

<p>
The restored project appears in the VB window.  The project name appears in the
title bar.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Open the form.
</p>

<p>
An icon for a folder of forms appears in the <b>Project</b> window on the right
side of the VB window.   Open this folder and select the form you saved.
Click on the <b>View Code</b> and <b>View Object</b> icons to display the
code or form layout windows.
</p>

<p>
Now you are ready to add controls and code to the form.  At any time, you can
use <b>File &gt; Save frmCounter</b> and <b>File &gt; Save Project</b>
to save your changes to the form and the project without going through
the <b>Save As ...</b> dialogs.
</p>
</li>

</ol>


<h4>How to write a VB program based on an earlier program</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Restore a saved VB program, as described in <b>How to Restore
...</b> above.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Make changes in the program. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Save the form and the project in a new folder, using <b>Save As
...</b> (not <b>Save</b>) as described in <b>How to Create ...</b>
above. 
</p>

<p>
Make sure you save the changed program in a different folder.  This is necessary
to ensure that the earlier program is preserved.  Be sure to save the form first.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
