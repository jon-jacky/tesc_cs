<b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> is an upper-division computer science
course. Topics include: algorithms for searching and sorting;
fundamental data structures including arrays, linked lists, and hash
tables; assessment of performance using Big-O analysis (including a
review of pertinent mathematics including powers and logs and the
growth of functions); program derivation and assessment of correctness
using assertions and loop invariants (including a review of logic and
boolean algebra and an introduction to programming language
semantics); Java programming techniques, especially using reference
variables (pointers) and linked data structures; programming language
support for data structures, including arrays (in most languages),
lists and trees (in Lisp and Scheme), and hash tables (in Awk and
Perl).  Assigned readings were technical articles from professional
journals.  Programming assignments included individual and group
projects assigned by the instructor, and projects chosen by the
students themselves.  Evaluations considered students' oral and
written reports on their projects (including their code), their
performance on short-answer quizzes, and their attendance, timeliness,
and other work habits.
