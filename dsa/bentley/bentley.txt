Data Structures and Algorithms - Second programming assignment

We'll reproduce the experiment described in Bentley's "Algorithm
Design Techniques", CACM 27(9), Sep 1984, 865-871 (also in his book
Programming Pearls, chapter 7 in the 1st edition, chapter 8 in the 2nd).

We'll divide up into groups.  Each group will implement one of the
algorithms, write a test driver for their algorithm, and execute their
algorithm.  Part of the assignment is to create meaningful test data
that checks both the correctness and performance of the implementation.

After each group has tested its own algorithm, it will then test all the
other group's algorithms.  Part of the assignment is to come up with an
approach for representing the drivers, test data, and algorithms that makes
it easy to do this.

We will all use the Java programming language for this assignment.

The first milestone is Thursday Oct 4.  Each group will give a brief oral
report on how their algorithm works and how they will implement it in Java.
It is not required to have a working Java implementation by this point,
but you should at least have a sketch, or an idea, or have identified some
important problems and issues.  You should also have a suggestion for how
the groups can make their implementations available to each other.

The groups are:

Algorithm 1 (p. 865)         Algorithm 2 (p. 866)     Algorithm 2b (p. 866)
--------------------         --------------------     ---------------------

Algorithm 3 (p. 867)          Algorithm 4 (p. 867)
--------------------          --------------------
