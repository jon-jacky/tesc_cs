Turn in your <b>self-evaluation</b> to the program secretary, Sharon
Wendt.  You can drop them off at her office, L3225 (there's a box by
the door if she's not in).  Or you can mail them to Sharon Wendt, The
Evergreen State College, Mail Stop L3220, 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW,
Olympia WA 98505-0002.  This self-evaluation goes in your transcript
and must be on the official form.  Your student evaluation of faculty
also goes to Sharon.  It is optional (it goes in my portfolio) and if
you choose to do one it must also go on the official form.
</p>

<p>
I also recommend (but do not require) that you give me a draft,
unofficial version of your self-evaluation to help me write my
evaluation of you (which goes in your transcript). I prefer hardcopy
but will accept email.

<p>
<b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> is an intensive one-quarter
immersion in some of the classic problems and techniques of computer
science, intended for strongly motivated students with programming experience.
We will hone programming skills, develop design judgment, learn to assess
correctness, and estimate resource requirements.  Students will make oral
presentations on computer science literature and on their own work.

<hr>

<h3><a name="learned">What we have learned</a></h3>

<p>
This program teaches many facts and techniques which are useful in
their own right, but the program contents were chosen to impart some
larger lessons.  Some of these concern the technical content.
</p>

<ul>

<!--
<li>
An algorithm is method for solving a problem, with or without a
computer.  
</li>
-->

<li>
The distinction between a problem (requirements or specification)
and a particular method for solving that problem (algorithm).
There can be different algorithms that solve the same problem.
</li>

<li>
The distinction between an algorithm and its realization in one
particular programming language.  (We'll use Java, but this is not
a Java programming course.  We'll look at other languages too).
</li>

<li>
Working from specifications and designs expressed in natural language,
pseudocode, or diagrams.
</li>

<li>
Different algorithms (that solve the same problem) can have wildly
different performances.
</li>

<li>
Analysis of performance (using counting).  The role of analysis versus
experiment (testing).
</li>

<li>
Quantification of performance: Big-O notation, the function concept,
sums, powers, logs, growth of functions.
</li>

<li>
Analysis of correctness (using assertions).  Analysis versus testing again.
</li>

<li>
References (pointers) and dynamic data structures.
</li>

<li>
Some useful examples of data structures and algorithms: sorting and searching,
arrays, lists and trees.
</li>

<li>
The distinction between an abstract data structure (such as
sequence) and its implementation in the constructs provided by
the programming language (such as arrays or linked lists).
</li>

<li>
The concepts abstract and concrete, specification
and implementation, as these concepts are used in computing.
</li>

<li>
The same algorithm (or data structure) can be useful in different contexts.
</li>

<li>
Design: the distinction between the core algorithms and data structures,
and the driver (main program).  Modularity, reuse, libraries.
</li>

<li>
Programming language support for data structures, including built-in
support (arrays in all languages, lists in Lisp, tables in Awk/Perl),
and libraries (the Collection class in Java).
</li>

<li>
Computability, intractability.
</li>

<li>
History and literature.  People have been at this for a long time.
Don't try to reinvent the wheel.
</li>

<li>
New directions: computing with DNA, quantum effects.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Other lessons concern practice and methodology.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Working from real-life sources (instead of being spoon-fed from textbooks).
<li>
Producing something presentable, a project or a product (not
just an exercise to be graded).
</li>
<li>
Working in groups, project management.
</li>
<li>
Presenting your work, explaining technical material.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This all builds on <a href="../fofc/learned.html">what we learned</a>
in earlier courses.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="readings">Readings</a></h3>

<p>
There is no textbook for this course.  Instead, our required readings
will be from notes and reprints handed out in class or downloaded from the web.
</p>

<p>
For the first several weeks we will work from some of Jon Bentley's
<em>Programming Pearls</em> columns, which were originally published in
a journal, <b>Communications of the ACM</b>.  The columns
were also published in two books, 
<a href="http://www.programmingpearls.com/"><b>Programming Pearls</b></a>
(1986, 2000) and <b>More Programming Pearls</b> (1988), but you do not need
to purchase them -- we'll hand out copies in class (the ACM grants
permission to copy this material without a fee).
</p>

<p>
The following table shows the Bentley articles we will study.  The
first column in the table gives the title of the article.  The next
columns give the volume, number, pages, month and year of the original
article in <b>Communications</b>, and the chapter numbers in the first
(1986, 1e) and second (2000, 2e) editions of the <b>Pearls</b> or
<b>More Pearls</b> books.
</p>

<p>
The current edition (2e) of <b>Pearls</b> is similar to the articles
we'll hand out.  The main difference is that he changed the pseudocode
in the program samples from Pascal-like to C-like, so in the papers
and 1e arrays range from <code>1..N</code> but in 2e they range from
<code>0..n-1</code>.
</p>

<p>
We'll begin with the <em>Algorithm Design Techniques</em> article.
We'll hand out copies at the first class.  I expect we'll spend at
least two weeks on it. I'm not sure about the schedule or the order of
the articles after that.  We may not even do all of them.
</p>

<p>
There will be other required readings, besides the Bentley articles.
I will announce them later.

<h3><a name="assign">Assignments</a></h3>

<p>
The first assignments will include some programming in Java.  There is
no required Java textbook.  If you have a Java book you like, bring it
to class.  There are links to many Java resources on this page from <a
href="../fofc/fofc-spring.html">another course</a>. The assignments
won't get into any Java arcana so if you know some other
block-structured imperative programming language you should be alright
(C, C++, Perl, Pascal, Basic, ...)

<p>
The Scheme (and Lisp) <tt>append</tt> function splices two lists.
(Acutually, it creates a <em>new</em> list containing a copy of the first list
followed by a copy of the second.  This Lisp function <tt>nconc</tt>
splices two lists in place, without making a copy.)  Here it is in action:
</p>

<pre>
> (append '(a b c) '(d e f))
(a b c d e f)
</pre>

<p>
The first line shows the Scheme command prompt &nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the expression I typed; the second line shows the value returned by Scheme.
</p>

<p>
Here is my version of <tt>append</tt> (I named it <tt>my-append</tt>
so it wouldn't overwrite the built-in <tt>append</tt>).  
Like all Lisp functions, it is itself a nested list.  It has no
variables or loops.  It does all its work by calling the basic
functions <tt>car</tt>, <tt>cdr</tt>, and <tt>cons</tt>, and by a
recursive call to itself. (Lisp and Scheme do provide variables and 
loops, but often you don't need them).
</p>

<p>
I created the file
<tt>my-append.scheme</tt> in the
<tt>/usr/users4/dsa/scheme</tt> directory on <tt>grace</tt>, 
with these contents :
</p>

<pre>
(define (my-append l1 l2)
  (if (null? l1)
      l2
      (cons (car l1) (my-append (cdr l1) l2))))     
</pre>

<p>
For comparison, you might consider how to write an append function
that works on linked lists in Java.
</p>

<p>
You usually use Scheme (or any other Lisp) by starting up the interpreter,
then typing the expressions you want to evaluate (alternatively, they
could come from a script file).  Typically, you begin by evaluating
some expressions that load the functions you want to use, then you
evaluate those functions.
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>MzScheme</b> is a command-line Scheme interpreter installed on
<b><tt>grace.evergreen.edu</tt></b> (so you can use it via a telnet
session).
Here is a transcript of part of my telnet session.  
The &nbsp;<tt>&gt;</tt>&nbsp;
symbol is the MzScheme command prompt, and the semicolon
&nbsp;<tt>;</tt>&nbsp; begins comments that I included for documentation.
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
The trace facility displays each invocation of a function, showing
its arguments and the value returned.  The vertical line connects
the the function call with the corresponding returned value.  This trace
shows the call to <tt>my-append</tt> that I typed in, and all the
recursive calls.  Notice how the first function call is the
last to return.
