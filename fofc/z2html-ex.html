<p>
Construct a web page by putting a file named <tt>z-test.html</tt>
in the <tt>web</tt> subdirectory of your login directory. 
This page will be available on the web at 
<tt>http://grace.evergreen.edu/~username/z-test.html</tt>. Prepare the
file and make it display properly, following these instructions:
</p>

<p>
Start with the TeX file with your last name in the
<tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/tex</tt> directory.  For example the
instructor's TeX file is <tt>jacky.tex</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Create your HTML file by using programs in the
<tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/bin</tt> directory.  The sed
program <tt>z2html.sed</tt> performs most of the processing, reading
TeX from the standard input and writing HTML to the standard output.
The awk program <tt>paragraph.awk</tt> does some post-processing,
reading HTML from the input and writing HTML to the output.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>z2html-cmd</tt> script in the <tt>z2html/bin</tt> directory
shows one way to coordinate the programs.  It takes the name of the 
TeX file as its only argument and writes the HTML to standard output.
However it only works when the script, the sed program, and the awk
program are all in the working directory.
</p>

<p>
When you have an HTML file, edit it to add a horizontal rule and
your name at the bottom.  See 
<tt>http://grace.evergreen.edu/~jackyj/z-test.html</tt>
</p>

<p>
The HTML file will only display properly if there is a subdirectory
named <tt>zimg</tt> in your <tt>web</tt> subdirectory, containing all
the GIF's mentioned in the HTML file.  There is an example at
<tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/zimg</tt>
</p>

<p>
The HTML file will only display properly in some browsers if there
is a <tt>zed.css</tt> file in your <tt>web</tt> subdirectory.  There
is an example at <tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/html/zed.css</tt>
</p>

<p>
(The TeX files are excerpted from these
<a href="http://www.radonc.washington.edu/prostaff/jon/z/z-examples.html">
Z notation examples</a>.  The programs and GIFs are from the 
<a href="http://www.radonc.washington.edu/prostaff/jon/z/z2html/z2html.html">
<b>Z2HTML</b> translator</a>.)

<h4><a name=hints>Hints</a></h4>

<p>
The <tt>z2html-cmd</tt> script takes one argument on the command line:
the name of the TeX file to translate.  It writes the translated HTML output
to the standard output.  To see the script in action, translating
<tt>jacky.tex</tt> and writing the HTML to your screen, <tt>cd</tt>
into the <tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/bin</tt> directory and execute this
command:
</p>

<pre>
   ./z2html-cmd jacky.tex
</pre>

<p>
You may have to put <tt>./</tt> in front of <tt>z2html-cmd</tt> (with
no spaces) to force the shell to execute the command because the
working directory <tt>.</tt> (dot) may not be in your path when you
log in on a machine in the ACC lab. (It seems the working directory is
in your path when you log in using telnet --- another one of those
little wrinkles.)
</p>

<p>
Each commands in the pipeline in <tt>z2html-cmd</tt> has options and
arguments.  The whole pipeline is

<pre>
   cat $1 | sed -f z2html.sed | awk -f paragraph.awk
</pre>

The meaning of each command in the pipeline is

<dl>
<dt><tt>cat $1</tt>
<dd>
Read the file named in the first command line argument and write
it to standard output (the next program in the pipeline).
<br>
</dd>
<dt><tt>sed -f z2html.sed</tt>
<dd>
Run the <tt>sed</tt> language interpreter, taking instructions from
the script in the file <tt>z2html.sed</tt> in the working directory.
Read text from standard input and write translated text to standard output.
<br>
</dd>
<dt><tt>awk -f paragraph.awk</tt>
<dd>
Run the <tt>awk</tt> language interpreter, taking instructions from
the script in the file <tt>paragraph.awk</tt> in the working
directory.  Read text from standard input and write translated text to
standard output.
<br>
</dd>
