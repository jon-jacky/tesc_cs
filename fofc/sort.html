<h4>Sorting examples, Foundations of Computing, Fall 2000</h4>

Brian Harvey, co-author of our textbook <b>Simply Scheme</b> compared
several sorting methods in a posting to the Usenet <code>comp.edu</code> newsgroup.

When I'm teaching data structures, in fact, I go ahead and lecture in
Scheme no matter what language the students are using.  There is
something really appealing about filling four chalkboards with

<pre>
(define (insertion-sort stuff)
  (if (null? stuff)
      '()
      (insert (car stuff)
              (insertion-sort (cdr stuff)))))
</pre>

<pre>
(define (selection-sort stuff)
  (if (null? stuff)
      '()
      (cons (smallest stuff)
            (selection-sort (remove (smallest stuff) stuff)))))
</pre>

<pre>
(define (mergesort stuff)
  (if (< (length stuff) 2)
      stuff
      (merge (mergesort (one-half stuff))
             (mergesort (other-half stuff)))))
</pre>

<pre>
(define (partition-sort stuff)
  (if (< (length stuff) 2)
      stuff
      (let ((pivot (guess-median stuff)))
        (append (partition-sort (filter (lambda (x) (< x pivot)) stuff))
                (filter (lambda (x) (= x pivot)))
                (partition-sort (filter (lambda (x) (> x pivot)) stuff))))))
</pre>

Only imagine that the last two are in a column next to the first two.
Then I can say "the first column (<code>insertion-sort</code> and
<code>selection-sort</code>) takes things one at a time, the second
column (<code>mergesort</code> and <code>partition-sort</code>) takes
things half at a time.  The first row (<code>insertion-sort</code> and
<code>mergesort</code>) divides arbitrarily and does the sorting in
the recombination; the second row (<code>selection-sort</code> and
<code>partition-sort</code>) sorts in the division, then just
recombines the results by concatenation."
