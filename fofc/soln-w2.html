<h4>Lab Quiz Solutions, Foundations of Computing, Week 2 -- Oct 3, 2000</h4>

<p>
This quiz is just exercise 3.9 from <b>Simply Scheme</b> (p. 38 in the first edition).
</p>

<p>
The expression <code>(+ 8 2)</code> has the value <code>10</code>.  It is a compound
expression made up of three atoms.  For this quiz, write five other Scheme 
expressions whose values are also the number 10:
<p>

<ol>
<li>An atom<br>
<p>
<code>10</code>  --- not <code>(10)</code> !
</p>
</li>
<li>Another compound expression made up of three atoms<br>
<p>
<code>(- 12 2)</code>  --- many other expressions would work also
</p>
</li>
<li>A compound expression made up of four atoms<br>
<p>
<code>(+ 5 3 2)</code> --- others would work
</p>
</li>
<li>A compound expression made up of an atom and two compound subexpressions<br>
<p>
<code>(+ (+ 3 2) (- 8 3))</code> -- others would work
</p>
</li>
<li>Any other kind of expression<br>
<p>
<code>(+ (* 4 2) 1 1)</code> -- etc.
</p>
</li>
