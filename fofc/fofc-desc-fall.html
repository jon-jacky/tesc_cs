<b>Foundations of Computing</b> is a three-quarter survey for students
beginning a computer science specialization, that covers many topics
in a meaningful but non-comprehensive way.  The learning objectives
are: to understand the basic concepts and vocabulary of programming
languages, operating systems, and networks; to write, test, and
document small programs in several contrasting programming languages:
Scheme (Fall), bash, sed and awk (Winter) and Java (Spring); to use
the Unix file system, shell commands, telnet, and a text editor; to
read and understand literature on the technology, history, management,
and social aspects of computing and to assess it in short writing
assignments and seminars.  Students were evaluated on their performance on 
short answer quizzes, on the quality and originality of their programming
projects, on their written reports on assigned readings, on their 
prepared oral seminar presentations, and on attendance, timeliness and
other work habits.

<b>Foundation of Computing</b>, Fall Quarter, has four primary
learning objectives: to write, test and document small
programs in the Scheme language, to understand and use some basic concepts
and vocabulary of computer programming, to read and understand
computer science literature and assess it in short writing assignments
and seminars, and to make oral presentations on technical topics.
