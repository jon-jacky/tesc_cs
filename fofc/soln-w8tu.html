<h4>Lab Quiz Solution, Foundations of Computing, Week 8 -- Tues Nov 14 2000</h4> 

<p>
This diagram represents the geographic relation of some cities in the
Puget Sound region of Washington state.  A line (possibly a crooked line)
connecting two cities means you can reach one from the other without
passing through any of the other cities.
</p>

<pre>
         Bremerton ------------- Seattle
             |                     |
             |                     |
             |                     |
             |                     |
         Gig Harbor -------------Tacoma
             |                     |
             |                     |
             |                     |
             +------ Olympia ------+
</pre>

<p>
Define a Scheme variable named <code>puget-routes</code> to encode
this diagram.  Represent city names by (double-quoted) strings so we
can easily represent cities whose names have more than one word:
"Seattle", "Gig Harbor" etc.  Represent the diagram as a list of
lists. The <code>car</code> of each list is the name of a city and the
<code>cdr</code> of each list is a list of all the cities that
can be reached from the first city.
</p>

<pre>
(define puget-cities
  '(("Bremerton" "Seattle" "Gig Harbor")
    ("Gig Harbor" "Bremerton" "Tacoma" "Olympia")
    ("Olympia" "Gig Harbor" "Tacoma")
    ("Tacoma" "Olympia" "Gig Harbor" "Seattle")
    ("Seattle" "Bremerton" "Tacoma")))
