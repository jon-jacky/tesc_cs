<h2>Your first Java programs</h2>

April 3, 2001

<hr>

<p>
Here are some suggestions for getting familiar with Java.
</p>

<h3>Demonstrate</h3>

<p>
Create a subdirectory for your Java programs.  You might want to 
create a subdirectory for each Java program.
</p>

<p>
Use an editor to create a file <tt>Demonstrate.java</tt> that contains
the <tt>Demonstrate</tt> class from page 10 in <b>On to Java</b>.
</p>

<p>
(There is also a copy of this program on grace in <tt>/usr/users4/fofc/java/winston</tt>.)

<p>
Compile the program:
</p>

<pre>
   $ javac Demonstrate.java
</pre>

<p>
Confirm that the compiler created a  new <tt>Demonstrate.class</tt> file.
</p>

<p>
Run the program:
</p>

<pre>
   $ java Demonstrate
   The rating of the movie is 23 
</pre>

<h3>Hello world (etc.)</h3>

<p>
Create your own "Hello world"-style program that uses <tt>print</tt>
or <tt>println</tt> to write messages on the screen.
</p>

<p>
Remember that the name of the file must be the same as the name of the
class in the file.
</p>

<h3>Echo</h3>

<p>
Copy, compile and run the <tt>Echo</tt> program in
<tt>/usr/users4/fofc/java/sample</tt> on grace.
</p>

<p>
This program shows how to read command line arguments, read from
standard input, and write to standard output in Java.  
</p>

<p>
You provide the input, by typing at the console or redirecting input
from a file.  Try different ways of running it:
</p>

<pre>
   $ java Echo
   Hello
   ...

   $ java Echo "> "
   > Hello
   ...

   $ java Echo < infile
   ...
</pre>

<h3>Client-server</h3>

<p>
Copy, compile, and run the <tt>Client</tt> and <tt>Server</tt> programs
in <tt>/usr/users4/fofc/java/client-server</tt> on grace.
</p>

<p>
Run both programs on your own computer.  Start each program in its own
terminal window.  A window will pop up for each.  Press the START
button on the Server window.  In the Client, make sure the IP address
is 127.0.0.1.  Type port number 1234 into the Client, type a message
and press SEND.
</p>

<p>
Use your Client to send a message to the Server running on the
computer at the next desk.  Its IP address should be on a label over
the monitor screen.
</p>

<p>
Observe what happens in the Client terminal window if you 
try to send a message when your Server isn't running, or if you
use the wrong port number or IP address.
</p>

<p>
Try the TermClient.  Type the IP address and port number on the command line like this:
</p>

<pre>
  $ java TermClient 127.0.0.1 1234
</pre>

<p>
Then type messages into the terminal window.
</p>

<p>
Since TermClient runs in the terminal window, you can use it in a
telnet session.  You can telnet to grace, run TermClient and use it to
communicate with a Server running on your computer at home.
