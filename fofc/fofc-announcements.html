<dt>02/21/01 awk notes</dt>
<dd>
I have put the sample programs and data from the Awk textbook on grace
in <tt>/usr/users4/fofc/awk</tt>.  They, along with other Awk links,
can be found <a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.<br><br> The
version of awk on grace is gawk (Gnu Awk).  It may not work exactly
the same as the version in the textbook.  According to the <b>Nutshell</b>
book and the online man page, you can use the <tt>-W traditional</tt> option
to make our awk behave like traditional awk.  You might want to
use <tt>alias awk='awk -W traditional'</tt><br><br>

<dd>
Reading assignments and presenters through Tuesday, January 30.<br><br>
About the reading, "A Spelling Checker" by Jon Bentley: <br>
  Skip the part about the hash table on p. 459 -- it's too 
  technical for us at this point.  In particular, skip the 
  part that begins about halfway down the first column, 
  "McIlroy used hashing ..."  Resume with the last paragraph 
  at the bottom of the right column, that begins "We've already 
  considered ..." 
  Ignore the Solutions for March's problems and the BASIC code on 
  p. 461. 
<br><br>

I'm talking about here, you might want to copy the new version.
