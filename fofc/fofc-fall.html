<h3><a name="languages">Languages</a></h3>

<p>
Programmers and other computer
specialists typically work in several languages, not just one.  The
differences are not merely superficial.  The languages have different
purposes, and each expresses a different notion of computation.
</p>

<p>
Fall quarter we will study Scheme.  Winter quarter we will add Awk and Java.
</p>

<p>
<b>Scheme</b> is a dialect of Lisp, one of the oldest and most
influential programming languages.  It was invented to support
research in artificial intelligence and programming language design,
but is also useful for general purpose programming 
(for example see this <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/develop/">cool stuff</a>
and this <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/code.misc.html">
esoteric stuff</a>).
Its simplicity and power make it an excellent
vehicle for learning programming.  
</p>


<p>
Here is a quick "Nutshell"-style tutorial that contrasts Scheme 
with other programming languages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.adelphi.edu/~sbloch/class/272/scheme.shtml">The Scheme Language</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is another course page with a brief Scheme tutorial and other links.
The sections on 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/341/98au/scheme/basics.html">basics</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/341/98au/scheme/recursion.html">recursion</a> provide another view of material we covered.
The section on 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/341/98au/scheme/eval-apply.html"><code>eval</code> and <code>apply</code></a> provides additional
explanation on material
from our last lecture.

Scheme Notes and Other Resources</a>
</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Here is the complete text of a classic Scheme textbook for advanced students:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://sicp.arsdigita.org/text/sicp/">
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
There is much more about Scheme 
<a href="http://www.schemers.org">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The other important Lisp dialect is Common Lisp, which is more complex
than Scheme but is probably used more in industry.  Here is
information about an excellent
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">Common Lisp textbook</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Awk</b> is a scripting language, intended to help programmers write
small but effective programs quickly.  It is particularly well-suited
for processing text patterns (in email messages, web pages, and other
network traffic) and tabular data (from spreadsheets, databases, and
other computer output).  Other popular scripting languages are Perl,
Python and Tcl, but Awk has a cleaner design and is easier
to learn.  It is excellent preparation for learning Perl which is similar but
much hairier.  Awk also has the same expression syntax (appearance and grammar
rules) as C, C++, Java, and Javascript and is good preparation for learning any of these.
</p>

<p>
<b>Java</b> is ... oh, you've heard of it? What matters for our
purposes is that it is representative of the most popular
general-purpose languages.  It has much in common with the older
workhorses C and C++ but is simpler and more reliable.

<h3><a name="textbooks">Textbooks</a></h3>

<p>
One of the goals of this course is to teach you to select and use computer
books effectively.
</p>

<p>
The Scheme book provides detailed explanations for beginners.  The Awk book
moves more quickly.  The Java book is terse, almost telegraphic.  After you have
learned these, you will be prepared to use reference manuals and "Nutshell"-style books.

<h3><a name="software">Software</a></h3>

<p>
The programming languages and tools for this course are installed on the 
computers at the 
<a href="http://192.211.16.12/user/computing/academic/home.htm">ACC lab</a>.  
During Fall term, we will be using <a href="win-howto.txt">Windows</a>.
During the rest of the year, we will also use Linux.
</p>

<p>
All of the programming languages and tools for this course are available for
free, and most run on several kinds of computers.  This makes it reasonable
for students to install and use the software at home if they wish.
</p>

<p>
We will use the <b>DrScheme</b> environment for programming in Scheme.
You can download DrScheme software and manuals for Windows, Linux, Macintosh and several
other platforms <a
href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/">here</a>.  You
can download the example programs from <b>Simply Scheme</b> <a
href="ftp://anarres.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/scheme">here</a>.  Here you
can download the <b>DrScheme</b> teachpack for <b>Simply Scheme</b>,
named
<a href="simply-teachpack.scm"><code>simply-teachpack.scm</code></a>.
To do the examples in <b>Simply Scheme</b>, you must load this
teachpack into <b>DrScheme</b> by selecting the <b>Language</b> menu,
then selecting <b>Add Teachpack</b> and navigating to
<code>simply-teachpack.scm</code> (in whatever folder you saved
it).
</p>

<p>
Here is on online manual for using <b>DrScheme</b> that summarizes some
of the material in the official manual:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/spider/cs124/drscheme.html">
Dr Scheme: A User Manual</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some online Scheme tutorials that take a different approach than our textbook:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/Teaching/Lectures/Released/">How to Design Programs</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html">
Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
You can download <b>Awk</b> for Windows 
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.
Awk comes included with Linux (where it is called gawk).
There is information about Awk for Macintosh 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-lang/awk/faq/">here</a>.
You can download the example programs from <b>The Awk Programming Language</b>
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sun's <b>Java</b> site is
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">here</a>.  The software we need must be
in there somewhere.  Watch this space for advice on what to 
download.

</ul>

<p>
To find the Help Desk entries, in DrScheme select <code>Help > Help Desk</code>, then
in <code>Find docs for:</code> type the topic, such as <code>make-posn</code>, then
select the entry, such as <code>Position Operations</code>.
</p>

<p>
To use <code>draw.ss</code>, you must set the language level to 
<code>Advanced Student</code> and load the <code>draw.ss</code> teachpack.
