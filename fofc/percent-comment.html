Here is the <a href="percent.html">problem statement</a> 
and a <a href="percent.html#soln">solution</a>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>
I awarded up to six points for each solution, one point each for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Read data into array elements</li>
<li>Loop over array elements</li>
<li>Calculate total of all elements</li>
<li>Calculate percent for each element</li>
<li>Print out results</li>
<li>Syntax and other details</li>
</ul>

<h3>Errors</h3>

<p>
A correct solution must compute the grand total of all the elements before it
can compute the percent contribution of any element.  In my solution,
I compute the total as I read in the data, before the END section.  Another
correct solution uses two for loops in the END section: the first computes
the total, and the second computes and prints out the percent contributions.
</p>

<p>
What does <em>not</em> work is to compute the total and the percent
contribution in the <em>same</em> loop in the END section.  Quite a
few students submitted incorrect solutions something like this:
</p>

<pre>
       ...
       # WRONG - computes total in same loop as percent
       for (i=1; i<=NR; i=i+1) {
         total = total + num[i]
         print id[i] " " num[i] ", " 100.0*num[i]/total "%"
       }  
       ...                  
</pre>

<p>
This is incorrect because it computes the percent from the running
total, not the grand total.  If you test it you will see it is
clearly wrong -- most obviously, it always says that the first element
contributes one hundred percent.
