<h4>Lab Quiz Solutions, Foundations of Computing, Week 3 -- Oct 10, 2000</h4>


<ol>
<li>
<p>
Write a procedure named <code>f</code> that, when applied to the
sample arguments, returns the sample result.  Your procedure may not
include any quoted data.
</p>

<pre>
> (f '(a b c) '(d e f))
(a d)
</pre>

<pre>
(define (f x y)
  (sentence (first x) (first y)))
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Write a procedure named <code>phase</code> that takes a number as an argument.  If
the number is less than zero, it returns <code>ice</code>.  If the number is
greater than one hundred, it returns <code>steam</code>.  Otherwise it returns
<code>water</code>.
</p>

<pre>
(define (phase x)
  (cond ((< x 0) 'ice)
        ((> x 100) 'steam)
        (else 'water)))
</pre>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Program A has a running time proportional to the number of items it
must process --- it's complexity is O(n).  Program B's running time is proportional
to the square of the number of items -- it is O(n<sup>2</sup>).  
Both programs process a test set of 100 items in one minute.
<p>

<p>
Can program A process 100,000 items a day? 
</p>

<p>
Yes. 100,000 items = 1000 x 100 items 
so running time = 1000 x 1 minute = 1000 minutes<br>
There are 24 x 60 = 1440 minutes in a day, which is more than 1000.

<p>
Can program B process 100,000 items a year?
</p>

<p>
No.  Running time here is 1000<sup>2</sup> = 1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000
minutes (a million minutes).<br> There are 1440 x 365 minutes in a
year, which is less than a million.
</li>
