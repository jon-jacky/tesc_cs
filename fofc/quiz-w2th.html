<h4>Lab Quiz, Foundations of Computing, Spring, Week 2 -- Thurs Apr 12 2001</h4> 

Name:<br><br><br>

<p>
A single file contains the following Java code (exactly as it appears
here, there is nothing else in the file).  The is compiled
by the Java compiler and the resulting Java program is run.
</p>

<pre>
public class Alpha {
    static boolean p = false;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
	logic(p);          
	Beta.logic(p);     
	logic(Beta.p);     
	Beta.logic(Beta.p);
    }

    public static void logic(boolean p) {
	boolean q = false;
	System.out.println(" p " + p + "   q " + q
			   + "    p && q  " + (p && q) 
			   + "    p || q  " + (p || q));
    }
}

class Beta {
    static boolean p = true;

    public static void logic(boolean p) {
	boolean q = true;
	System.out.println(" p " + p + "   q " + q
			   + "    p && q  " + (p && q) 
			   + "    p || q  " + (p || q));
    }
