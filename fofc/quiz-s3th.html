<h4>Lab Quiz, Foundations of Computing, Spring, Week 3 -- Thurs Apr 19 2001</h4> 

Name:<br><br><br>

<p>
A single file contains the following Java code (exactly as it appears
here, there is nothing else in the file).  The is compiled
by the Java compiler and the resulting Java program is run.
</p>

<pre>
public class Delta {
    static int a = 1;
    static int b = 3;

    public static void show(int b) {
	int c = 5;
	System.out.println(" a " + a + "  b " + b + "  c " + c);
    }

    public static void main(String argv[]) {
	show(b);
	show(Gamma.b);
	Gamma.show(b);
	Gamma.show(Gamma.b);
    }
}

class Gamma {
    static int a = 2;
    static int b = 4;

    public static void show(int b) {
	int c = 6;
	System.out.println(" a " + a + "  b " + b + "  c " + c);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
What output does the program produce?  (Don't worry about getting 
the exact number of spaces or lining up the columns exactly  -- just
write the output reasonably neatly.)
