<p>
Winter quarter we will study systems composed of many programs, 
including operating systems and networked applications.

<h3><a name="languages">Languages</a></h3>

<p>
We will continue our study of problem-solving in contrasting programming 
languages.  Fall quarter we studied Scheme.  This quarter we will add Awk and Java.
</p>


<p>
<b>Awk</b> is a scripting language, intended to help programmers write
small but effective programs quickly.  It is particularly well-suited
for processing text patterns (in email messages, web pages, and other
network traffic) and tabular data (from spreadsheets, databases, and
other computer output).  Other popular scripting languages are Perl,
Python and Tcl, but Awk has a cleaner design and is easier
to learn.  It is excellent preparation for learning Perl which is similar but
much hairier.  Awk also has the same expression syntax (appearance and grammar
rules) as C, C++, Java, and Javascript and is good preparation for learning any of these.
</p>

<p>
<b>Java</b> is ... oh, you've heard of it? What matters for our
purposes is that it is representative of the most popular
general-purpose languages.  It has much in common with the older
workhorses C and C++ but is simpler and more reliable.

<h3><a name="os">Operating Systems</a></h3>

<p>
An <em>operating system</em> is a collection of programs that work
together to provide the services of a computer in a convenient form to
users and programmers.
</p>

<p>
In Fall term, we will have become familiar with the ubiquitous
<b>Windows</b> operating system.  In Winter, we will learn and use
<b>Linux</b>, a popular modern version of the vastly influential
<b>Unix</b> operating system.
</p>

<p>
In addition to using Windows and Linux,
we will study the strategies their designers adopted for organizing
large software systems.
</p>

<p>
As we learn the Unix operating system, we will learn the Awk programming language.
</p>

<p>
Here is page of links on Unix and Linux including tutorials, command
summaries, history, humor, etc.:

<h3><a name="net">Networked Applications</a></h3>

<p>
When you use a computer these days, it is likely that you are actually
working with several different computers that communicate 
over a network.  For example, when you use a web browser your computer
communicates with remote server computers that send the content 
you see in the web pages.
</p>

<p>
We will study how networked applications are constructed and experiment 
with building some ourselves.
</p>


<p>
We will use the Java programming language to experiment with networked applications.
</p>

<h3><a name="textbooks">Textbooks</a></h3>

<p>
We will use the 
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">Awk book</a> 
and the 
<a href="http://www.ascent.com/books/#OnToJava">Java book</a>
that were required <a href="fofc-fall.html#textbooks">Fall Quarter</a>.
</p>

<p>
These new books are also required:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mcp.com/sams/detail_sams.cfm?item=0672315246">
<b>Sams Teach Yourself Linux in 10 Minutes</b></a>, John R. Ray, 
ISBN 0-672-31524-6, 
Sams Publishing (MacMillan Publishing Company), 1999, 212 pages.  
About $13.

<b>Linux in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference</b></a>, 
Third Edition, Ellen Siever, Jessica P. Hekman, Stephen Figgins, Stephen Spainhour,

<h3><a name="other">Other books</a></h3>

<p>
Here are some helpful Unix/Linux books.  They provide explanation and
motivation that is missing from reference books like <b>... 10 Minutes</b> and
<b>... Nutshell</b>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe/">
<b>The Unix Programming Environment</b></a>, Brian W. Kernighan and
Rob Pike, ISBN 0-13-937681-X (paperback), 0-13-937699-2 (hardback),
Prentice-Hall, 1984, about $35 (paper). An early classic.  The first
four chapters on the file system, filters and pipes are superb and
suitable for beginners.  The rest of the book is for serious Unix C
programmers.  Nothing on networks or graphics.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.tux.org/~lasser/think-unix/">
<b>Think Unix</b></a>, Jon Lasser, ISBN 0-7897-2376-x, Que, 2000,
about $30.  Good explanations of the Unix philosophy, covers many
topics including networks and graphics.  Not comprehensive but complements
the reference books nicely.
</p>

<p>
Here are some other network books I considered before I chose <b>Java
Network Programming</b>.  They provide some useful material but aren't
very technical and don't have any programming examples.  
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/catalog.asp?ISBN=1-55860-536-3">
<b>Networked Applications: A Guide to the New Computing Infrastructure</b></a>, 
David G. Messerschmitt, 1999, Morgan Kaufmann,
About $40. Good topic coverage but no technical examples, exercises or projects.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sunsite.ee/books/books/vanderLinden3/vanderLinden3.html">
<b>Not Just Java</b></a>, 
Peter Van der Linden, About $40.  Covers many
of the same topics as Messerschmitt, very heavy on the pro-Java,
anti-Microsoft advocacy, a few light technical examples but no
exercises or projects.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852330112/baobabcomputing/002-9088369-1609625">
<b>Middleware</b></a>, 
Daniel Serain (translated by Iain Craig), ISBN 1-85233-011-2,
Springer UK, 1999, about 250 pages.  Good but very brief coverage of many
topics, but no exercises or projects.
</p>

<h3><a name="software">Software</a></h3>

<p>
There is a staggering amount of information about Linux online, as well as
the software itself.  A good starting point is <a href="http://www.linux.org">
www.linux.org</a>.   The Linux distribution on the ACC lab computers
is from <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Awk</b> comes included with Linux (where it is called gawk).
You can download Awk for Windows 
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.
There is information about Awk for Macintosh 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-lang/awk/faq/">here</a>.
You can download the example programs from <b>The Awk Programming Language</b>
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/awkbook/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sun's <b>Java</b> site is <a href="http://java.sun.com/">here</a>.
The latest version of the language and development environment is
called the Java 2 SDK, version 1.3.  You can download it for Windows
or Linux <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/">here</a> (be warned,
it's huge - not practical to download without a cable modem or DSL).
There is an article about Java on Macintosh <a
href="http://www.rainwatersoft.com/java4u/java_savvy_mac_8_9/">here</a>.
Apple's own Java site is <a
href="http://developer.apple.com/java/index.html">here</a>.
