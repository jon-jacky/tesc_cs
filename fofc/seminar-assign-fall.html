<h3>Reading assignments</h3>

<p>
Reading assignments appear on the <a
href=seminar-sched-fall.html>seminar schedule</a>.  Readings will be
distributed (in the seminar classroom) at least one week in advance of
the seminar.
</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>
Bring a brief report on your reading to every class meeting.  Reports
will be collected at the beginning of class.  Your reports will be
considered in your evaluation.  They also serve as an attendance
record.
</p>

<p>
Reports should be very brief, with one or two sentences on each
of these three items:
</p>

<ol>
<li>A brief description of the content of the reading.
<li>Something in the reading that you found notable or memorable.
It could be a fact or an opinion that the author expressed.
<li>A reponse to the reading: an observation, opinion, or question of your own.
</ol>

<p>
Some weeks there may be more than piece (article, chapter) of assigned reading.
You should still only submit three sentences.  The sentences may apply to one
of the readings, or all of them, or each may apply to a different piece.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is my report in this format for the September 28 assignment.
I chose to write all three sentences about the preface to Simply Scheme:
</p>

<blockquote>
The preface to Simply Scheme explains the authors' rationale for
choosing the Scheme programming language (over Pascal or something
similar) for an introductory programming course.  I was struck that
they characterize Pascal (etc.) as "conservative" and its teachers as
"uptight authoritarians" while they consider Scheme "radical".  I
disagree; I think that the choice of programming language is a pragmatic
matter, not an ideological one.
</blockquote>

<h3>Presentations</h3>

<p>
Each student is appointed to present one of the readings in
class.  The presenter  summarizes the content of the reading
and begins the discussion.
</p>

<p>
The instructor assigns the date and reading assignment for each
student's presentation.  Presenters will be appointed at least one
week in advance of the seminar.  They appear on the <a
href=seminar-sched-fall.html>seminar schedule</a>.
</p>

<p>
Your presentation will be considered in your evaluation.
