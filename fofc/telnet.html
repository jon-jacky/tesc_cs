<h3>Telnet</h3>

<p>
The telnet program enables you to use almost any Internet-connected
computer to use a (suitably configured) remote system that is also
connected to the Internet.  For example, you can run telnet on your
home computer (running Windows perhaps) and work on the Evergreen lab
computers running Linux, almost as if you were sitting right there in
the ACC lab.  Each telnet session provides you with a text-only
terminal window.  This enables you to use a Linux shell and a text
editor such as emacs or vi.  However, you cannot use a graphical
desktop such as KDE or Gnome over telnet.
</p>

<h3>Start telnet, connect, and log in</h3>

<p>
Here are the instructions for using telnet to connect to the
Evergreen Linux systems from a computer running Windows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect to your Internet Service Provider. (If you have an "always
on" DSL or cable modem connection this step may not be
necessary.)</li> 
<li>Run telnet from the Windows Start menu: Click
<b>Start</b>, Click <b>Run</b>, in the dialog box type
<tt>telnet</tt>, Click <b>OK</b>   The telnet window appears.</li>
<li>In the telnet window, select the <b>Terminal</b> window, select
<b>Preferences</b>.  Make sure <tt>VT-100/ANSI</tt> is checked 
(not <tt>VT52</tt>).  On my system the arrow keys work if
<tt>VT100 Arrows</tt> is <em>not</em> checked.  
You may wish to select a font etc.  I like Font: FixedSys, Font Style: Regular,
Size: 14, black letters on white bckground</li>
<li>In the telnet
window, select the <b>Connect</b> menu.  Select <b>Remote System</b>.
In the dialog box, type <tt>grace.evergreen.edu</tt> to connect to the 
Evergreen Linux systems, click on <b>Connect</b>.</li>
<li>You should see some messages, then the <tt>login:</tt> prompt.</l>
<li>Type your username and password at the prompts.  Use the same 
username and password that you use in the ACC lab.  After you successfully
log in, you should see a Unix shell prompt.</li>
<li>Now you can type any Unix shell command.  Try <tt>pwd</tt> and 
<tt>ls</tt> first, to get oriented.</li>
<li>When you are done, type <tt>logout</tt> at the shell prompt.</li>
<li>To exit telnet, select the <b>Connect</b> menu, then <b>Exit</b>.
</ol>

<p>
Alternatively, you may be able to connect using the browser (Internet
Explorer, Netscape, or ...) by typing in the URL
<tt>telnet:/grace.evergreen.edu/</tt>.  If you use the DOS command prompt,
you can just type <tt>telnet</tt> or <tt>telnet grace.evergreen.edu</tt>
</p>

<p>
You may run several telnet sessions to obtain several terminal windows
on the remote system.  Many telnet users like to have one window for
the shell and another for the editor.
</p>

<h3>Configure your telnet session</h3>

<p>
Some Linux commands and programs will not work properly over some
telnet sessions unless you tweak the configuration.  The easiest way
to do this is to execute commands in a shell script.  I have placed
the commands in the script in <tt>~jackyj/.bashrc.telnet</tt> Copy
this script into your login directory.  Then, type this command right
after you log in using telnet (but not when you log in at the ACC lab using
the Linux login screen):
</p>

<pre>
   source .bashrc.telnet
</pre>

<p>
These are the commands in <tt>.bashrc.telnet</tt> at this writing:
</p>

<pre>
   export TERM=vt100
   alias emacs='emacs -nw -l ~/.emacs.telnet' 
</pre>

<p>
You should not put these commands in your <tt>.bashrc</tt> because 
they should not be in effect when you work in the ACC lab. (If you
really understand <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and <tt>.bashrc</tt> you can
tinker with both so you don't need to type the <tt>source</tt> command
when you log in using telnet -- but don't try that until you're an expert).
</p>

<h3>Edit using emacs</h3>

<p>
Emacs will not work properly over some telnet sessions unless you
tweak the configuration.  The easiest way to do this is to place the
configuration commands in an emacs startup script.  I have placed them
in <tt>~jackyj/.emacs.telnet</tt> Copy this script into your login
directory.  Then, to start emacs, just type <tt>emacs</tt>.  The alias
defined in <tt>.bashrc.telnet</tt> should load the script.
</p>

<p>
Emacs behaves a bit differently over a telnet session. The main
difference is that <tt>C-h</tt> does not invoke help, it now invokes
backspace (just like the backspace key).  To get emacs help over a
telnet session, use <tt>M-?</tt> instead.  If that doesn't work, use
<tt>M-x help</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Other emacs commands that may present problems over telnet are 
<tt>C-SPC</tt> (set mark) and <tt>C-s</tt> (search forward).
If these don't work, you can use <tt>M-x set-mark-command</tt> and
<tt>M-x search-forward</tt>.
</p>

<p>
These are the commands in <tt>.emacs.telnet</tt> at this writing:
</p>

<pre>
   (global-set-key "\C-h" 'backward-delete-char) ; backspace not help
   (global-set-key "\M-?" 'help-command) ; this is help instead
   (menu-bar-mode nil) ; menu bar is useless over telnet
</pre>

<p>
You should not put these commands in your <tt>.emacs</tt> because 
they should not be in effect when you work in the ACC lab.
</p>

<h3>FTP</h3>

<p>
If you prefer not to edit over telnet, there is an alternative.  You
can edit text files on your own computer (using a text editor such as
Notepad, <em>not</em> a word processor such as Word or Wordpad), then
copy the files to Evergreen using ftp (file transfer program).
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to use ftp from a Windows system is to bring up 
a DOS command prompt (Start->Run, type Command), then type
<tt>ftp grace.evergreen.edu</tt>.  Here is a sample session:

<pre>
   C:\fofc> ftp grace.evergreen.edu
   Connected to grace.evergreen.edu. 
   220 grace.evergreen.edu FTP server (Version wu-2.4.2-VR17(1) Mon Apr 19 09:21:53 EDT 1999) ready.
