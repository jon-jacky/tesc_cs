Name:<br><br><br>

<p>
A file contains the following Java code (exactly as it appears
here, there is nothing else in the file).  The file is compiled
by the Java compiler and the resulting Java program is run.

<pre>
class Thing {
    int x;
    public Thing(int i) { x = i; }
}

public class CopyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
	int i = 0, j = 1;
	System.out.println("1. i is " + i + "  j is " + j);
	j = i;
	System.out.println("2. i is " + i + "  j is " + j);
	i = i + 1;
	System.out.println("3. i is " + i + "  j is " + j);

	Thing a = new Thing(0); Thing b = new Thing(1);
	System.out.println("4. a.x is " + a.x + "  b.x is " + b.x);
	b = a;
	System.out.println("5. a.x is " + a.x + "  b.x is " + b.x);
	a.x = a.x + 1;
	System.out.println("6. a.x is " + a.x + "  b.x is " + b.x);
    }
