   The name of the song is called "HADDOCKS' EYES."'

  `Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?' Alice said, trying to
feel interested.

  `No, you don't understand,' the Knight said, looking a little
vexed.  `That's what the name is CALLED.  The name really IS "THE
AGED AGED MAN."'

  `Then I ought to have said "That's what the SONG is called"?'
Alice corrected herself.

  `No, you oughtn't:  that's quite another thing!  The SONG is
called "WAYS AND MEANS":  but that's only what it's CALLED, you
know!'

  `Well, what IS the song, then?' said Alice, who was by this
time completely bewildered.

  `I was coming to that,' the Knight said.  `The song really IS
"A-SITTING ON A GATE":  and the tune's my own invention.'
