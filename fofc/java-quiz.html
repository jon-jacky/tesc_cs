<p>
A single file contains the following Java code (exactly as it appears
here, there is nothing else in the file).  The file is compiled
by the Java compiler and the resulting Java program is run.
</p>

<pre>
class Foo {
    public static void println() {
	System.out.println("Foo");
    }
}

public class FooDemo {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
	System.out.println("FooDemo");
	Foo.println();
    }
}
</pre>

In the preceding program (in class <tt>Loop</tt>), 
what happens if the statement
<tt>a[4] = "Epsilon";</tt> is added to the line marked <tt>// init</tt>?
