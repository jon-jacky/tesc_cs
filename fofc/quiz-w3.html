Write a procedure named <code>f</code> that, when applied to the
sample arguments, returns the sample result.  Your procedure may not
include any quoted data.

<li>
<p>
Write a procedure named <code>phase</code> that takes a number as an argument.  If
the number is less than zero, it returns <code>ice</code>.  If the number is
greater than one hundred, it returns <code>steam</code>.  Otherwise it returns
<code>water</code>.

<p>
Program A has a running time proportional to the number of items it
must process --- it's complexity is O(n).  Program B's running time is proportional
to the square of the number of items -- it is O(n<sup>2</sup>).  
Both programs process a test set of 100 items in one minute.
<p>

<p>
Can program A process 100,000 items a day? 
</p>

<p>
Can program B process 100,000 items a year?
