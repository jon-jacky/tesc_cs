Two files contain the following Java code (exactly as it appears
here, there is nothing else in the files).  The files are compiled
by the Java compiler and the resulting Java program is run.

<pre>
// Ticket.java
public class Ticket {
    static int n = 0;

    public static void total() { 
	System.out.println(n + " tickets have been issued");
    }

    int ticket;

    public Ticket() {
	ticket = n;
	n++;
    }

    public void speak() {
	System.out.println("I have ticket " + ticket);
    }
}

// TicketDemo.java
public class TicketDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Ticket a, b, c;
	Ticket.total();
	a = new Ticket(); a.speak(); Ticket.total();
	b = new Ticket(); b.speak(); Ticket.total();
	c = new Ticket(); c.speak(); Ticket.total();
    }
