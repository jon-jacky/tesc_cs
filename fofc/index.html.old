This is ~jackyj/web/fofc/index.html

It is almost like ~jacky/web/index.html except it links to other pages
in the same directory rather than the fofc subdirectory of this directory.

This version is necessary because the links to "Jon Jacky" at the bottom
of each page in this directory point to index.html in the same directory, 
not the directory above.  In other words, they point to this page.

This is my page at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/user/home.htm">
The Evergreen State College</a>.
I also have a <a href="http://www.radonc.washington.edu/prostaff/jon/">page</a>
at the University of Washington.

In the Fall 2000 -- Spring 2001 academic year I am teaching <a
href="fofc.html">Foundations of Computing</a> in the 
<a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/user/PTS/home.htm">Part-Time Studies</a>
program.
</p>

<p>
I am rarely on the Evergreen campus, except when I am teaching a
class, so it's no use trying to reach me at my on-campus office or
telephone.  Instead, send me email (address below).  I try to check
email most weekdays.

The lecture/seminar classroom for Spring Quarter is <b>Library 1612</b>,
same as Winter.  The first class of the quarter will meet there
at <b>5:30 pm, Tuesday April 3</b>.  We will continue in the ACC lab at 7:30.
</p>

<p>
In Spring 2000 I taught <a href="../cofc/cofcii.html">Concepts of Computing</a>.
