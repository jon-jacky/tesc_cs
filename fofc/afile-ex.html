<h4>Lab Assignment, Foundations of Computing</h4>

<hr>

<p>
Write an awk program to check file type.
</p>

<p>
Name the program <tt>afile</tt>.  The program reads from standard
input.  The program writes one line containing one word to standard
output, indicating the type of the input: <tt>HTML</tt>,
<tt>Scheme</tt>, <tt>Numeric</tt>, <tt>Text</tt>, or <tt>Other</tt>.
<p>

<p>
This example shows one way to run the program on a file named
<tt>foo.dat</tt>.   Here <tt>afile</tt> detects that <tt>foo.dat</tt>
contains numeric data:

<pre>
    $ cat foo.dat | awk -f afile
    Numeric
</pre>

<p>
The criteria used to identify each type of file are described in these pages,
and summarized in line here:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://grace.evergreen.edu/~cccon18/afile.html">HTML</a>
- contains an <tt>&lt;HTML&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt>
tag anywhere in the file</li> <li><a
href="http://grace.evergreen.edu/~gutkim14/afile.html">Scheme</a> -
contains the pattern <tt>(define (</tt> anywhere in the file (note the second parentheses)
</li> <li><a
href="http://grace.evergreen.edu/~saberi11/afile.html">Numeric</a> -
contains only the digits <tt>0</tt> - <tt>9</tt> and the special
characters <tt>$ % * . / ^ =</tt> and the space character.</li> <li><a
href="http://grace.evergreen.edu/~mikdon04/afile.html">Text</a> -
contains only bytes with (octal) ASCII codes in the range <tt>000</tt>
- <tt>177</tt></li>
<li>
Other - anything else, including GIF's, JPEG's, binary executables etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To understand the definition of the text file type, it may be useful
to refer to a table of ASCII codes.  Here are some samples from the
web:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html">
This table</a> shows the octal codes.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.physics.udel.edu/wwwusers/watson/scen103/ascii.html">
This table</a> shows the control character names and control key 
sequences but doesn't show the octal codes.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~plangford/ascii.html">
This table</a> shows the extended 8-bit codes (plus a lot of 
annoying ads).
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The file types are not mutually exclusive -- the first three 
file types are also text files -- so your program must test for file type
in this order: <tt>HTML</tt>, <tt>Scheme</tt>, <tt>Numeric</tt>,
<tt>Text</tt> and <tt>Other</tt>.  So <tt>Text</tt> really means the
file is a text file which is not also an HTML file, Scheme file, or
Numeric file.  The <tt>Other</tt> category should include binary files
including GIF's, JPEG's, executable code (as found in the files
in the <tt>bin</tt> directories) etc.
</p>

<p>
The assignment is due in the lab on Thursday, March 15.
