<h3>Quizzes</h3>

<p>
There may be a short quiz at the beginning of any lab session.  The
quiz will cover any course material (usually laboratory but perhaps
seminar readings also) assigned through the previous Thursday.  Your
quiz scores will be considered in your evaluation.  Your quiz also
serves as an attendance record.
</p>

<h3>Final Exam</h3>

<p>
There will be a final exam on Scheme in the last lab meeting of the quarter,
on December 7.  The final exam will cover the material that was covered in the
quizzes all quarter.  Your exam score will be considered in your evaluation.
</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p>
There are four programming assignments.  Your assignments will be
considered in your evaluation.

<p>
The first three assignments are due at the beginning of the
lab (at 7:30 pm).  The due dates are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Assignment 1: Tuesday October 17 (week 4)</li>
<li>Assignment 2: Tuesday November 7 (week 7)</li>
<li>Assignment 3: Tuesday November 28 (week 9)</li>  
<li>Assignment 4: Thursday December 7 (week 10)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each assignment, write and run a Scheme program.  You must turn in
three items.  The three items must be on paper (email submissions are
not accepted).  Each item must fit on one page (one side).  They are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
A <b>problem statement</b> that says what the program does (not how it
works).  The problem statement should be so precise that you could
give the statement to another programmer and they could write a program that
exhibits the same behavior as yours.
</p>
<p>  
Be brief.  One or a few sentences is fine.  For example you
can just say, "This is my solution to exercise <em>m</em> on page
<em>n</em> in Simply Scheme," and then copy the problem statement from
the book.
</p>
<p>
Make the problem statement self-contained so the instructor
can evaluate your assignment without the book (or any other sources) at hand.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <b>program</b> itself (Scheme code).  If the program is 
based on an example in a book, cite the book and page number in 
a comment.  If your program is longer than one page, hand in an excerpt that 
fits on one page.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A <b>sample program run</b> showing input and output.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The items you should turn in should be self-explanatory.  It should be
possible for the instructor to evaluate your assignment by inspecting
these items, without observing a demonstration.
</p>

<p>
The content of your assignment is up to you.  Here are some options:
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Copy and run an example from the textbook (or from some other
source).  This is a minimal but acceptable way to fulfill the assignment.
</li>
<li>
Solve an exercise from the textbook (or some other book).
</li>
<li>
Solve a problem posed by the instructor.
</li>
<li>
Solve a problem you pose yourself.
</li>
<li>
Work on a project through the term.  For each assignment, turn in 
a problem statement, program excerpt, and sample program run showing
the state of the project at that time.  You must still observe the length
limit on each assignment you turn in.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The assignment should brief. If asked, you should be able to
demonstrate it and explain it in less than five minutes.
</p>

<p>
Assignments will be evaluated on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Precision: the problem statement should say what the program does.
</li>
<li>
Correctness: the program should do what the problem statement says.
</li>
<li>
Attribution: if the problem statement or program is based on an example
in a book (or some other source), the source should be cited accurately.
If you worked with another student (or anyone else), acknowledge them.
<li>
Difficulty
</li>
<li>
Originality
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To do well, you will need to do much more work than you turn in.  You
should work through the examples in the textbooks and attempt as many
exercises as you can.  Try out your own ideas.  Create a portfolio by
saving your better work in files that you keep all quarter.  The
assignments you turn in should be your own selection of the best work
in your portfolio.
</p>

<p>
You may work with (one or more) other students on your assignment, but each student 
must turn in an assignment and acknowledge any others who contributed in the
problem statement and/or code (as appropriate).  The instructor may meet with
each student to assess their individual contribution.
