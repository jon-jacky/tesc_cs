<h4>Lab Assignment, Foundations of Computing</h4>

<hr>

<p>
Write a sed script to translate English to Pig Latin.
</p>

<p>
English words that begin with vowels are translated by adding
the suffix <tt>way</tt>: <tt>apple</tt> becomes <tt>appleway</tt>,
<tt>under</tt> becomes <tt>underway</tt> etc.   Words that begin
with consonants are translated by moving the consonant to the end
of the word and adding the suffix <tt>ay</tt>: <tt>dog</tt> becomes
<tt>ogday</tt>, <tt>trouble</tt> becomes <tt>roubletay</tt>.  To make it
easy, we'll just handle the first letter rather than the first phoneme
(sound), so you can translate <tt>this</tt> to <tt>histay</tt> (not
<tt>isthay</tt> as a native Pig Latin speaker might do it).
</p>

<p>
To make this easy, you can assume that your source text will only
contain lower case letters, spaces, and linebreaks.  (After all, we
already know how to write scripts to translate files to this form).
Your script need not handle capital letters, digits, punctuation, tabs
etc. etc.
</p>


<p>
Turn in one sheet of paper that shows your script, a short sample of
English input, and the translated Pig Latin output.
</p>

<p>
You are encouraged to work in groups to write the script.  You must
list the other co-authors of the script on your assignments.  You must
use your own unique English input.
</p>

<p>
The assignment is due in the lab on Tuesday, February 27.
