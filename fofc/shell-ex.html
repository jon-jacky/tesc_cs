<h4>Lab Assignment, Foundations of Computing</h4>

<hr>

<p>
Write a shell script to construct a web site by creating HTML pages
from all the TeX pages in the <tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/tex</tt>
directory, based on the scripts in the
<tt>/usr/users4/fofc/z2html/bin</tt> directory.  Put all the new HTML pages in
the <tt>web</tt> subdirectory of your home directory.  The name of
each new HTML file must be different and must end in <tt>.html</tt>;
other than that, you may name the new files as you wish.
</p>

<p>
It may be helpful to review the 
<a href="z2html-ex.html">instructions for the previous assignment</a>, and
your solution.
</p>

<p>
Write another script to create an index page named
<tt>z-index.html</tt> in your <tt>web</tt> subdirectory.
This page will contain one link for each of the new HTML files
created by your first script.
</p>

<p>
Turn in both scripts.
