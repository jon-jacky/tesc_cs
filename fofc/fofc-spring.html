<h2>Foundations of Computing -- Spring 2001</h2>


<h2>Jon Jacky</h2>

<p>
Spring quarter we will study networked applications and experiment
with building some ourselves, using the Java programming language.
</p>

<p>
In seminar we will learn about working in the computing field.  We
will also consider issues that can arise when systems are placed into
use: reliability, safety, usability, security, and social and economic
effects.
</p>

<p>
We may consider other topics based on students' and
instructor's interests.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lecture and Seminar:</b> Tuesdays and Thursdays 5:30 -- 7:00 pm, L1612
</p>


<p>
<b>Laboratory:</b> Tuesdays and Thursdays 7:30 -- 9:30 pm, ACC lab
(L2610 in the 
<a href="http://192.211.16.12/user/computing/academic/home.htm">Computer Center</a>).
</p>

<p>
Our last class meeting on Thursday evening, June 7, will be a

sign-up sheet</a> for contributions (contact Sandy McDonald to add yours).

Here is a detailed but still provisional week-by-week

<h3><a name="textbooks">Textbooks</a></h3>

<p>
We will use the two Java books that were assigned earlier:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ascent.com/books/#OnToJava">
<b>On to Java</b></a>, 
2nd edition, Patrick Henry Winston and Sundar Narasimhan,
ISBN 0201385988, Addison-Wesley, 1998, 379 pages.  About $25.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javanp2/">
<b>Java Network Programming</b></a>, 
Second edition, Elliotte Rusty Harold
ISBN 1-56592-870-9, O'Reilly and Associates, 2000, 731 pages, about
$40
</p>


<p>
We will read this book on the computer industry:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=060980698X">
<b>High Stakes, No Prisoners</b></a>, Charles Ferguson,
ISBN 0-609-80698-X, Random House, 1999, about $15
</p>



<hr>

<h3><a name="other">Other books</a></h3>

<p>
Here are some good books about the history of the Internet and Web.
They cover the same story as in Ferguson's Chapter 2 but in much
greater depth.  
What seems inevitable and obvious now required extraordinary vision,
ingenuity, and cooperation sustained over several decades.
</p>

<p>
<b>Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet</b>, Katie
Hafner and Matthew Lyon, Simon and Schuster, 1996.  Also in paperback.
Mostly about creating the Arpanet in the 60's and 70's, based on
interviews with the original builders.  Briefer material on more
recent history.
</p>

<p>
<b>Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the 
World Wide Web by its Inventor</b>, Tim Berners-Lee, HarperSanFrancisco,
1999.  Like it says in the title.
</p>

<p>
There are zillions of Java books.  Besides the assigned textbooks,
I've found this to be the most useful.  
</p>

</p>
<b>Java in a Nutshell</b>, 3rd ed., David Flanagan, O'Reilly, 1999,
640 pages, about $30.  Starts with a 230-page textbook-style
introduction to Java which complements <b>On to Java</b> nicely, then has a
400-page reference on most of the packages in the Java
platform (but not including the graphical user interface
packages AWT and Swing, which are in another Nutshell book).
</p>

<p>
I wish we had more time to spend on design. 
This book is the best place to start.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us
Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity</b>, Alan Cooper, SAMS, 1999.
About $15 in paper.  Argues that programmers
are the wrong people to design most computer-based
products, but they usually end up doing it anyway.  Proposes a new
discipline, interaction design.  Provides lots of anecdotes and
practical advice on design, business, software engineering, and
project management.  Here's the <a
href="http://www.cooper.com/cb_tiarta_chapter.htm"> first chapter</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are some other network books I considered before I chose <b>Java
Network Programming</b>.  They provide some useful material but aren't
very technical and don't have any programming examples.  
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/catalog.asp?ISBN=1-55860-536-3">
<b>Networked Applications: A Guide to the New Computing Infrastructure</b></a>, 
David G. Messerschmitt, 1999, Morgan Kaufmann,
About $40. Good topic coverage but no technical examples, exercises or projects.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sunsite.ee/books/books/vanderLinden3/vanderLinden3.html">
<b>Not Just Java</b></a>, 
Peter Van der Linden, About $40.  Covers many
of the same topics as Messerschmitt, very heavy on the pro-Java,
anti-Microsoft advocacy, a few light technical examples but no
exercises or projects.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852330112/baobabcomputing/002-9088369-1609625">
<b>Middleware</b></a>, 
Daniel Serain (translated by Iain Craig), ISBN 1-85233-011-2,
Springer UK, 1999, about 250 pages.  Good but very brief coverage of many
topics, but no exercises or projects.
</p>

<h3><a name="software">Software</a></h3>

<p>
You can write Java programs in the ACC lab, telnet to
<tt>grace.evergreen.edu</tt> from home, or install Java on your own
computer.  Java software is available for free on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's Java site</a> has tons of
software and documentation.  The software we will use in this course
is called <b>Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, Version 1.3</b> (also
called the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, or J2SE).  You can
download it for Windows or Linux <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/">here</a>.  Be warned it is huge
-- about 25 MB -- so it could take hours to download over a phone
line.
</p>

<p>
There is an article about Java on Macintosh <a
href="http://www.rainwatersoft.com/java4u/java_savvy_mac_8_9/">here</a>.
Apple's own Java site is <a
href="http://developer.apple.com/java/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="online">Online tutorials, documentation, code, etc.</a></h3>

<p>
The documentation at Sun's Java site is indexed <a
href="http://java.sun.com/docs/index.html">here</a>.  It provides
the complete text of several (expensive) books, including the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html">Java language specification</a> itself.  The most useful
links for our purposes are these tutorials:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html">    
Tutorials</a> on many topics.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</ul>

<p>
Sun's SDK includes a lot of <b>demonstration Java code</b> that
you can study and run. On
<tt>grace</tt> it is under <tt>/usr/local/java/jdk1.2.2/demo</tt>, in
my Linux distribution it is under <tt>/usr/java/jdk1.3/demo</tt>, and
in my Windows distribution is it under <tt>C:\jdk1.3.0_02\demo</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The Sun site does not provide the <b>Java platform source code</b>
in convenient form.  They say you probably don't need it.
If you sign a license agreement you can 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/communitysource/">download</a> it.
