<h2>Foundations of Computing, Winter Quarter 2001</h2>

<h2>Jon Jacky</h2>

<p>
<b>Foundations of Computing</b> is a three-quarter sequential program
intended to give the beginning -- yet strongly motivated -- student a
foundation for a computer science specialization.  We will cover
important computer science areas including theory and practice.  In
each of these areas students will be exposed to critical topics in a
meaningful though non-comprehensive way. Programming projects will
develop technical skills.  Readings and seminars will develop
presentation skills and critical judgment.
</p>


<p>
Winter quarter we will continue our study of problem-solving in
contrasting programming languages.  We will study systems composed of
many programs, including operating systems and networked applications.
</p>

<p>
More information about all three quarters appears on the course web page at
<a href="http://grace.evergreen.edu/~jackyj/fofc/fofc.html">
<b><code>http://grace.evergreen.edu/~jackyj/fofc/fofc.html</code></b>
</a>

<p>
<b>Reference #:</b> 00252G
</p>

<p>
<b>8 quarter hours.</b>
Credit will be awarded in computer science and technology issues.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Concepts of Computing or equivalent,
Foundations of Computing fall quarter or equivalent.
</p>

<p>
This a three-quarter sequential program.  It was intended that
students begin in Fall term and continue through Winter and Spring.
Instructor's permission is required to enter the program in Winter.

<h3><a name="languages">Programming Languages</a></h3>

<p>
Programmers and other computer
specialists typically work in several languages, not just one.  The
differences are not merely superficial.  The languages have different
purposes, and each expresses a different notion of computation.
Fall quarter we studied Scheme.  Winter quarter we will add Awk and Java.
</p>


<p>
<b>Awk</b> is a scripting language, intended to help programmers write
small but effective programs quickly.  It is particularly well-suited
for processing text patterns (in email messages, web pages, and other
network traffic) and tabular data (from spreadsheets, databases, and
other computer output).  Other popular scripting languages are Perl,
Python and Tcl, but Awk has a cleaner design and is easier
to learn.  It is excellent preparation for learning Perl which is similar but
much hairier.  Awk also has the same expression syntax (appearance and grammar
rules) as C, C++, Java, and Javascript and is good preparation for learning any of these.
</p>

<p>
<b>Java</b> is representative of the most popular general-purpose
languages.  It has much in common with the older workhorses C and C++
but is simpler and more reliable.  We will use Java to experiment with
networked applications.
</p>

<h3><a name="os">Operating Systems</a></h3>

<p>
An <em>operating system</em> is a collection of programs that work
together to provide the services of a computer in a convenient form to
users and programmers.  In Fall term, we became familiar with the
ubiquitous <b>Windows</b> operating system.  In Winter, we will learn
and use <b>Linux</b>, a popular modern version of the vastly
influential <b>Unix</b> operating system.
</p>

<p>
In addition to using Windows and Linux, we will study the
strategies their designers adopted for organizing large software
systems.
</p>

<h3><a name="net">Networked Applications</a></h3>

<p>
When you use a computer these days, it is likely that you are actually
working with several different computers that communicate 
over a network.  For example, when you use a web browser your computer
communicates with remote server computers that send the content 
you see in the web pages.
</p>

<p>
We will study how networked applications are constructed and experiment 
with building some ourselves.
</p>

<h3><a name="seminar">Seminar readings</a></h3>

<p>
I am considering these:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fred Brook's essay on architectural integrity 
from <b>The Mythical Man-Month</b>
</li>

<li>
Excerpts from early papers on the Unix philosophy in <b>The Bell
System Technical Journal</b> volume 57, Number 6, part 2, July --
August 1978: the <em>Forward</em> by McIlroy et al. (pps. 1899 --
1903) and the <em>Retrospective</em> by Ritchie (pps. 1948 -- 1949).
</li>

<li>
"Inside Windows 95" by Andrew Schulman, Chapter 8 in <b>Windows 95 in a Nutshell</b>
from O'Reilly. (This chapter does not appear in their Windows 98 Nutshell book)
</li>

<li>
Something about peer-to-peer applications like Napster, Gnutella, instant messaging etc.
</li>


<li>
Maybe something about Microsoft's COM
</li>

<li>
More ...
