<a href="https://github.com/jon-jacky/tesc_cs">Courses</a>
I taught at The Evergreen State College:
</p>

<p>
<a href="cofc/cofcii.html">Concepts of Computing</a>: Spring 2000 
</p>

<p>
<a href="fofc/fofc.html">Foundations of Computing</a>:
Fall 2000, Winter 2001, Spring 2001.
<a href="fofc/fofc-desc-fall.html">Summary</a>.
I especially like 
<a href="fofc/learned.html">this page</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="dsa/dsa.html">Data Structures and Algorithms</a>: Fall 2001.
<a href="dsa/dsa-desc.html">Summary</a>.
</p>

<p>
Evergreen also keeps copies of these pages at its archives:
<a href="http://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/1999-2000/cofc99/cofcii.html">Concepts</a>,
<a href="http://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/2000-2001/fofc00/fofc.html">Foundations</a>, and
<a href="http://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/2001-2002/dsa01/dsa.html">Data Structures</a>.
Their versions might differ from mine.  In particular, my <em>Data
Structures</em> page has many broken links to missing files, but the
files are present and the links work at the Evergreen archive.  Also,
the <em>Data Structures</em> directories <a href="">here</a> contain
many files which are not reachable from the course page because the
links there do not use the correct names or paths.  I do not plan to
fix these.  Again, these links do work at the Evergreen archive.
